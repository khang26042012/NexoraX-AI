## Project Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript with TailwindCSS (CDN) and Marked.js (CDN)
- **Backend**: Python 3.12 HTTP server (built-in modules only)
- **Port**: 5000 (single server for both static files and API proxy)
- **Host**: 0.0.0.0 (configured for Replit proxy requirements)

### Current Configuration
- **Workflow**: "NexoraX AI Server" running `python3 server.py`
- **Deployment**: Configured for autoscale deployment target
- **Dependencies**: No external Python packages required (uses built-in modules)
