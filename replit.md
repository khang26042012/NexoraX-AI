## Project Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript with TailwindCSS (CDN) and Marked.js (CDN)
- **Backend**: Python 3.12.11 HTTP server (built-in modules only)
- **Port**: 5000 (single server for both static files and API proxy)
- **Host**: 0.0.0.0 (configured for Replit proxy requirements)

### Current Configuration
- **Workflow**: "NexoraX AI Server" running `python3 server.py`
- **Deployment**: Configured for autoscale deployment target
- **Dependencies**: No external Python packages required (uses built-in modules)

- `POST /api/puter` - Puter.ai proxy (GPT-5, Claude)

### Deployment Notes
- Configured for autoscale deployment (best for web apps)
- Uses PORT environment variable when deployed
- No build step required (static files + Python server)
- Production-ready CORS and security settings
- API keys from config.py will work in production

## Status
ðŸŸ¢ **READY FOR DEPLOYMENT** - Project is fully configured and operational in Replit.

### Deployment Instructions
1. Click the "Deploy" button in Replit
